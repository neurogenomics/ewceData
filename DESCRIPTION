Description: This package provides reference data required for ewce. Expression 
            Weighted Celltype Enrichment (EWCE) is used to determine which cell 
            types are enriched within gene lists. The package provides tools 
            for testing enrichments within simple gene lists (such as human 
            disease associated genes) and those resulting from differential 
            expression studies. The package does not depend upon any particular 
            Single Cell Transcriptome dataset and user defined datasets can be 
            loaded in and used in the analyses.
